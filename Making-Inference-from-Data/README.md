### Project Overview

 The role of a data scientist is to answer questions on data and give insights. Think of a data scientist trying to do research on fellow data scientists. If we want to research about the Data Scientists some of the examples of research questions we would like to ask are as follows

What is the average salary of a Data Scientist?
What percentage of Data Scientists hold a doctorate?
Are data scientists paid more than data engineers?
To answer the above questions accurately we will have to conduct a census and ask each and every data scientist the questions, but as you may have realized we cannot ask every person in this population of data scientists. Instead what we can do is pick out a random sample out of the population and ask these questions and make inference from the response received.
For the above-mentioned research questions, the population comprises of all the Data Scientists on planet earth. The key point here for the data scientist is deciding whether the observation on the small sample hold for the complete data or not. For example, if a data scientist's average salary based on the sample is found to be $100,000 does it hold true for the entire population of data scientists? The inference is all about finding answers to such questions.

Statistical inference is the process of making a judgment about a population based on sampling properties. An important aspect of statistical inference is using estimates to approximate the value of an unknown population parameter.

Let's try and understand the words "Sample" & "Population" and break down the above statement using an example.

Leading up to U.S. presidential elections it could be very useful to know the political leanings of every single eligible voter, but surveying every voter is not feasible. Instead, we could poll some subset of the population, such as a thousand registered voters, and use that data to make inferences about the population as a whole.
This "subset" of the population is nothing but the sample data. We carry out various tests on the Sample to gain insight into the larger population out there!

Statistical inference helps us to answer various such questions based on the samples drawn from the entire population. There are two broad areas of statistical inference that we are going to discuss in this chapter viz. Statistical Estimation and Hypothesis Testing.

**Statistical Estimation
**
Following are some of the questions that we can answer using Statistical Estimation

What is the average salary of a Data Scientist in the bay area?
What proportion of Data Scientists holds a doctorate degree?
Here as you can see we are trying to find the values of population parameters based on the sample.

A parameter is a descriptive measure of the population. - Example: Population mean, Population variance etc. A statistic is a descriptive measure of the sample. - Example: Sample mean, Sample variance etc.

**Hypothesis Testing
**
Following are some of the questions that we can answer using Hypothesis Testing

Is the average salary of Data Scientists in the Bay Area and Montreal the same?
Is the salary of the Data Scientist and his Education independent of each other?
Is the average salary of Data Scientists in Montreal greater than $100k
Here you can see that we are trying to answer certain questions regarding the population. Most of the times we have certain assumptions about population parameters, hypothesis testing is a way to decide whether these assumptions stand true based on the data from a sample.

**Statement of CLT
**
The central limit theorem (CLT) is a statistical theory that states that given a sufficiently large sample size from a population with a finite level of variance, the mean of all samples from the same population will be approximately equal to the mean of the population. Furthermore, on taking multiple samples from the same population, the mean of the individual samples will form a normal distribution pattern, with all variances being approximately equal to the variance of the population divided by each sample's size.






### Learnings from the project

 Problem Statement
Bank Of New York wants to expand its branches and for that, it has a certain hypothesis and statements it wants to verify. Using the inferential statistics method you just learned, help the bank.
It has data from 9578 customers with the following 15 features:

After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to use inferential statistics. In this project, you will apply the following concepts:

Confidence Interval

Central Limit Theorem

Hypothesis Testing

Chi-Square Test
